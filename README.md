# Bruce McClure Portfolio Website

## Goal
The goal of the site is to communicate all relevant information to prospective employers in a professional manner.  The site is not meant to be feature filled or distract the user from its actual content. The content is the main feature of the site. 


## Instructions
### How to use the site:
This site is simple and intuitive. There is a landing page with the heading and a navigation arrow which brings the user to the navigation page. Thereafter there are links to different pages with information the user may find useful. The user may with scroll in each direction or use the navigation arrows to move through the site.

### Supported devices
All devices capable of using web browsers will be able to access this site. 

#### Browsers
The only feature which may not be supported on this site is smooth scrolling. This is a very minor aspect of the site and it will not interfere with any information being accessed by the user. 

#### Resolutions
The sites format will change depending on the width of the viewport. It was designed from a mobile first perspective and its media breakpoint rests at 800px. With the extra screen real estate there is additional information displayed to the user which was not possible on mobile devices. 

## Design Brief
A simple design with one page and a fixed background in order to give the impression that the 
tiles were moving over the screen downwards instead of the user scrolling down the page.  It is imperative that the site does not come across as a gimmick and etract attention from the actaul information on the screen. 


### What do I want out of my page?
A clean and simple site which displays all information a prospective employer may wish to know 

### Inspiration
The general trend of minimalist design resonates with me as a person. I would like to reflect that in my work.
