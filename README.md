## Goal
The goal of the site is to communicate all relevant information to prospective employers in a professional manner.  The site is not meant to be feature filled or distract the user from its actual content. The content is the main feature of the site. 


## Instructions
### How to use the site:
This site is simple and intuitive. There is a landing page with the heading and a navigation arrow which brings the user to the navigation page. Thereafter there are links to different pages with information the user may find useful. The user may with scroll in each direction or use the navigation arrows to move through the site.

### Supported devices
All devices capable of using web browsers will be able to access this site. 

#### Browsers
The only feature which may not be supported on this site is smooth scrolling. This is a very minor aspect of the site and it will not interfere with any information being accessed by the user. 

#### Resolutions
The sites format will change depending on the width of the viewport. It was designed from a mobile first perspective and its media breakpoint rests at 800px. With the extra screen real estate there is additional information displayed to the user which was not possible on mobile devices. 

## Design Brief
A simple design with one page and a fixed background in order to give the impression that the 
tiles were moving over the screen downwards instead of the user scrolling down the page.  It is imperative that the site does not come across as a gimmick and etract attention from the actaul information on the screen. 


### What do I want out of my page?
A clean and simple site which displays all information a prospective employer may wish to know 

### Inspiration
The general trend of minimalist design resonates with me as a person. I would like to reflect that in my work.

### Extra questions

Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)

While different “versions” of the internet existed prior to 1980 it was propularized and brought into the mainstream in the 1980s. Dial-up phone lines were used which enabled broader access to the internet meaning email was viable. This was alos the decade where local area networks were established making personal life aswell as business far more streamlined.  

HTML was developed in 1990 which itself is not a programming language but still extremely valuable to the internet as a whole. This was the first introduction to the world wide web as we know it today. Microsoft launched windows 95 and companies such as Amazon, Yahoo and Ebay were all launched in 1995. This was the decade where it became apparent that the internet would need to be governed and not a “lawless free for all” 

The early 2000s saw the dominance of Google which made internet navigation easy and intuitive. This brought information technology to the world at a much faster rate. Not to mention the arrival of the smartphone from apple. The smartphone meant that information and indeed social media would be carried around with everyday people at all times. 

Today one can do all computing from a web browser, not only that but one could do all shopping and social interactions from the web. We have truly entered a new era. 
.

Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)

DNS - The internet heavily relies on DNS (Database of network names and IP addresses) . Without it the internet would essentially be unsearchable. DNS is colloquially known as the “phonebook of the internet”. It is a comprehensive translation system used to search the internet. It assigns user friendly names to unique IP addresses. 

Domains - A domain is your name or space on the internet. When you register a domain name it becomes your property. It is a piece of internet realestate. The most popular are .com .net and .org. You may register your domain for a pre agreed amount of time. The name of your website will come before the .com and it will be unique. 

Web-servers - There are computers which store websites. The files stored on web servers are read by browsers which interpret the files into what we know as websites.  The purpose of these machines is to serve files to the computer trying to access them. 


Web browser - This is the program which reads the html and css files and displays it on the screen for us to see the website as the designer and programmer intended. They have become very intricate in contemporary times and as such people are able to do the vast majority of their computing needs via their web browsers. 


Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)

The internet before sophisticated search engines meant that one would need to know where one was going prior to the search itself. This made things difficult if you were not 100% certain about what information you were looking for exactly. 

The perfection of google search algorithms and search engine optimisation have enabled the world to access with such efficiency that it is almost unheard of to check the second page of google's returned search results. The term google is so synonymous with internet searches that it has been added to the oxford English dictionary. 

Equally important. Google has maintained social responsibility with its software  and provided a feature for safe searching in order to filter out unwanted content, .
